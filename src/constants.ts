Username: ${username}

Conduct a deep online reputation research for this username with source citations. Identify any negative statements, scandal involvement that leaked to media, and controversial statements.

Provide a blogger reputation score from 0 to 100, confidence level from 0 to 100, and full explanation.

Example response:
"
Below is a brief, practical online reputation research for the username marinevignes /
Marine Vignes (public figure, TV host). I searched official profiles,
encyclopedic entries, news articles, and tabloid publications — sources are cited after
each key finding.

Reputation score: 85
Confidence level: 83

Brief Summary

*   Marine Vignes is a French TV host and media personality (weather and lifestyle programs),
    publicly represented in media and on her own social media accounts (Instagram, Threads).
*   Overall profile and media mentions are neutral-positive (interviews, TV project participation,
    advertising/brand collaborations).
*   No proven serious legal accusations, criminal cases, or major ethical scandals
    (corruption/violence/fraud type) found in public sources. Main "scandals" are rather
    tabloid headlines and discussions in yellow press.

Negative / Controversial Findings

1.  Publications about plastic / aesthetic surgery and appearance.

    — Several tabloid articles and interviews cover that she underwent mini-facelift/aesthetic
    medicine procedures; this is presented in some publications as a "scandal" or topic for
    discussion about plastic surgery among public women. Such materials are more common in Voici,
    Programme-TV, Purepeople, etc. (yellow press).
2.  Diet topics / "controversial" weight loss advice.

    — Tabloids feature headlines about "controversial" diets / weight loss tips,
    sometimes with emotional evaluative language. These publications are not
    investigations, but reports/interviews and headlines designed for reaction.
3.  Public attention to personal life (past relationships, children, custody).

    — As a former partner of a famous TV host (Nagui), her family life, custody issues,
    and memories of past relationships are periodically discussed in media — sometimes in
    "drama/property division/custody" format in tabloids. But no evidence of court disputes or
    accusations in public sources — mostly interviews and human-interest materials.
4.  Occasional fake headlines/reposts on social media.

    — Search revealed several reposts and pages on Facebook/low-quality sites that
    hype "scandal" for clicks; such sources should not be trusted without
    verification. Recommend not relying on single social media posts without links to
    verifiable media.

Reputation Risk Assessment

*   Low-medium: main risks are image-related (yellow press, appearance discussions,
    diets), not legal or criminal. If you need assessment for business/HR check,
    note that almost all controversial mentions come from tabloids (Voici,
    Purepeople, Programme-TV, etc.), not from reliable investigative publications.

Specific Sources (main references used)

1.  Encyclopedia / biographical references: French Wikipedia — profile and basic biography.
2.  Official Instagram / author profile (posts, account description).
3.  Articles / interviews (Programme-TV, Voici, Purepeople, etc.) — materials about plastic surgery,
    diets, personal life interviews.
4.  Photos / stock and event shots (Getty, Purepeople, BestImage).
5.  Other media materials and podcasts (interviews, brand partnerships).

Methodology (brief)

*   Searched by full name and username: "Marine Vignes", "marinevignes", checked
    Instagram/Threads, encyclopedias (Wikipedia, IMDb), news results (French media) and
    yellow press results.
    Separately checked for court/legal records and major investigations — not found.

Verify yourself until you are satisfied with the result.

---

## Parameters to Evaluate

### 1. Blogger’s Income Level

**Score = 100** if the blogger demonstrates a **European premium / luxury or higher lifestyle**

If visual signals are mixed, sparse, or partially obscured, reduce Confidence accordingly.

---

### 2. Talking Head Presence

Score = 100 if the blogger personally speaks on camera, looking directly into the lens, actively explaining and persuading ("talking head" format).

This applies equally to Stories and Reels.

The blogger:

Appears in frame themselves (their face is clearly visible)

Looks into the camera while speaking

Speaks personally, not via voice-over

Delivers content in an engaged, explanatory manner (not passive narration)

Strong visual signals:

Face centered or dominant in frame

Eye contact with the camera

Mouth movement consistent with speech

Expressive facial movements and gestures typical of explanation or persuasion

Self-recorded framing typical of Stories/Reels

If the face is partially visible, frames are low-quality, or speaking cannot be confidently inferred, reduce Confidence accordingly.

---

### 3. Alignment With Beauty & Self-Care Products

Score = 100 if the blogger’s content identity is clearly associated with self-care, beauty, and becoming a better version of oneself in terms of appearance.

Assessment is based on what the blogger consistently talks about and demonstrates in their content, not on a single post.

The blogger must have ongoing content related to self-care and making oneself more beautiful (not necessarily in every post, but as a stable, recognizable theme).

The blogger may:

Talk about different aspects of the beauty industry:

new cosmetics or skincare products

care routines and treatments

beauty or wellness gadgets

new ingredients and formulations

Discuss compositions, textures, aromas, and sensations

Use beauty devices and explain them

OR not use devices but regularly visit cosmetologists or clinics

OR focus mostly on home care routines

What matters is that the blogger can be clearly associated with the theme:

“How to take care of yourself and make yourself look better.”

Important inclusion cases:

Bloggers whose main topic is sports or fitness (making the body look better) are acceptable if:

they sometimes also talk about facial care, skincare, procedures, or beauty products

Clear exclusion rule:

Bloggers who never talk about self-care, beauty, or appearance improvement are not suitable.

Strong positive (green-flag) signals include visible presence of:

Masks with active ingredients (AHA/BHA, enzyme, oxygen, carbonated, etc.)

Microcurrent therapy

LED masks (home or professional)

Gua sha massage or rollers made from natural stone

Multi-step skincare routines (5+ steps: toner, essence, serum, ampoules, etc.)

Under-eye patches with anti-aging or deep hydration effects

Hair and scalp spa care (peels, ampoules, massages, “hair happiness” treatments)

Fractional mesotherapy or mesorollers

Anti-cellulite massage and body wraps

Beauty devices from original premium brands (not mass-market knockoffs)

If self-care / beauty appears only sporadically or weakly, reduce Confidence accordingly.

---

### 4. Absence of Low-End Retail Advertising

**100** — No advertising for AliExpress, Shein, Temu, Aldi, Lidl, or similar low-cost retailers detected in provided video frames.
Allowed: Costco, Target, Zara, Mango.

---

### 5. Pillow Advertising Constraint

**100** — No pillow advertising detected OR only Sleep & Glow pillows are advertised.

---

### 6. Advertising Focus Consistency

Score = 100 if advertising shown in the provided video frames is thematically consistent and coherent, without a mix of unrelated product categories.

The blogger must NOT advertise a random assortment of heterogeneous products.

Clear negative signal (score downgrade):

Presence of advertising for absolutely unrelated categories within the same creator’s content set, such as:

cookware (pans, pots, kitchen sets)

clothing or fashion items

cosmetics or skincare

aroma candles

home decor or interior accessories

household items with no shared theme

Advertising is considered inconsistent when:

Products do not share a common theme, lifestyle, or problem space

Ads look opportunistic rather than aligned with the blogger’s core identity

Multiple unrelated categories appear without a unifying narrative or positioning

Score = 100 only if:

Advertising focuses on one clear category or on closely related categories

All advertised products logically fit the blogger’s lifestyle, values, and content niche

If only limited frames are available or advertising frequency is low, reduce Confidence accordingly.
---

### 7. Advertising Quality (Sales Authenticity)

**Score = 100** if the frames and readable on-screen text/captions indicate **highly authentic, trust-based advertising**, not scripted or generic promotion.

When advertising is present, the blogger:

**Personal usage & realism**

* Clearly explains **how the product is used**
* Explains **when** it is used (time, routine, situation)
* Explains **why** it is used (personal motivation)
* Describes **specific situations** in which the product is relevant
* Demonstrates the product in a **realistic, non-idealized way** (not overly polished or staged)

**Lifestyle integration**

* Shows that the integration is **not random**
* Demonstrates that the product **supports and fits their lifestyle**, habits, or routines
* Product appears naturally embedded into daily life shown in frames

**Concrete details & specificity**

* Mentions **specific, tangible effects or observations**:

  * e.g. “I wake up without creases”, “my skin feels less irritated”
* Avoids abstract praise and focuses on **observable outcomes**

**Contextual integration**

* Connects the integration to context or audience interaction:

  * “you often ask what I use”
  * “I was looking for something to fix morning creases”
* Avoids abrupt transitions like “Now advertising” unless the format explicitly requires it

**Authentic voice & tone**

* Uses **their own natural manner of speech** and personal tone
* Does not sound like reading a script or brand copy

**Credibility & restraint**

* Avoids exaggerated or absolute claims (“the best product in the world”)
* Focuses on **specific advantages**, not empty superlatives

**Real need → solution link**

* Describes a **real personal problem or need**:

  * acne, sensitive skin, frequent travel, lack of sleep, irritation, etc.
* Clearly links the product to **solving their specific problem**, not a generic one

**Trust-enhancing nuance**

* May mention a **small nuance, limitation, or wish**
* Light imperfection is treated as a **positive trust signal**

If readable captions/on-screen text are missing and speech cannot be reliably inferred from frames, **reduce Confidence accordingly**, even if the visual presentation appears premium.

---

### 8. Frequency of Advertising

* **100** — Advertising appears inside the content
* **0** — No advertising present across the analyzed content

---

### 9. Structured Thinking & Argumentation

**Score = 100** if the blogger demonstrates **clear, structured, and reasoned thinking**, going far beyond simple statements like “I like / I don’t like”.

The blogger **does NOT limit themselves to opinions**, but:

* Explains **why** they think so
* Provides **examples from practice**:

  * personal experience ("on myself", "in my routine")
  * experience with others (clients / followers, if visible via captions)
* Clearly links **cause and effect**:

  * “if you do X, Y usually happens”
* Sometimes **compares approaches**:

  * “this works like this, while that works differently, because…”

**Language & clarity requirements:**

* Speaks in **simple, clear sentences**, without unnecessary filler
* Explains complex terms **when they are used**
* Avoids excessive professional jargon not common outside expert sources
* Gives not only **“what to do”**, but also **“why it works”**

**Mandatory argument types to look for:**

1. **Arguments based on personal experience**

   * first‑person statements
   * visible routines or repeated personal usage

2. **Arguments based on observation and comparison**

   * before / after comparisons
   * comparison with alternatives or analogs
   * explanation of differences
   * explanation of why one option worked and others did not

3. **Logical and cause–effect arguments**

   * clear explanation of why a certain effect occurs
   * reasoning chains (X → Y → result)

4. **Arguments through concrete usage scenarios**

   * shows *how*, *when*, and *in which situations* something is used
   * usage tied to real-life context

**Strong scoring formats:**

* Before / after comparisons
* Comparison with analogs
* Explanation of distinctions
* Explanation of why this method worked and others failed

If readable captions/on‑screen text or clear speaking‑to‑camera cues are **absent**, significantly **reduce Confidence**, even if the visual style appears polished.

---

### 10. Knowledge Depth & Usefulness

**Score = 100** if the blogger demonstrates **high relevance, freshness, and rarity of transmitted knowledge**, even without formal expert credentials.

The assessment must be based on **how far the information is from mass awareness** and **at what stage of societal diffusion the knowledge currently is**.

Use the following **knowledge diffusion levels**:

1. **Scientific innovation** — information originates from narrow academic or scientific journals and research circles
2. **Narrow professional knowledge** — known to a small group of professionals, circulates in specialized or semi-academic publications
3. **Professional mainstream (priority level)** — accessible to a wide professional audience and starting to appear in high-quality press
4. **Advanced enthusiast knowledge (acceptable)** — known to deeply engaged enthusiasts and hobbyists, already present in popular media
5. **Mass / overused knowledge** — widely known, generic, repeated, and commonly encountered

**Primary target level:** **Level 3**
**Acceptable:** Level 4 (since most bloggers operate in this zone)
Levels **1–2** are strong positive signals but rare.
Level **5** should significantly lower the score.

**Key evaluation criteria:**

* Rarity of information relative to mass content
* Actuality and freshness (not outdated or recycled insights)
* Presence of non-obvious details, nuances, or trade-offs
* Evidence that the blogger understands *why* the concept works, not just *what* it is

**Strong signals include:**

* Explaining concepts before they become widely popular
* Translating professional knowledge into accessible explanations
* Highlighting limitations, conditions, or edge cases
* Connecting insights to real-world application shown in frames or captions

If there is **no readable caption/on-screen text** or clear evidence of knowledge transmission, **reduce Confidence accordingly**, even if the visual presentation appears premium.

---

### 11. Age Over 35

* **100** — provided video frames strongly indicates blogger is over 35
* **0** — provided video frames strongly indicates blogger is under 35

---

Evaluate across two dimensions:

**Speech & Thinking:**

* Clear and logical structure of speech
* Rich but precise vocabulary (without overload)
* Ability to explain complex ideas in simple terms
* Consistency and ability to justify positions
* Presence of irony or self-irony (optional but strong signal)

**Analytical Ability:**

* Quickly grasps the essence of topics
* Highlights the main points without getting lost in details
* Compares and generalizes
* Demonstrates critical thinking (does not accept everything at face value)

---

### 13. Personal Values & “Own Truth”

**Score = 100** if the blogger consistently demonstrates a **personal worldview, values, and principles**, going beyond simple documentation of events.

The blogger **does not merely show events** ("what I eat / do / visit"), but **actively interprets them**.

**1. Interpretation of events (mandatory):**

* Explains **why** they act or choose something in a particular way
* Expresses **personal likes and dislikes**, not neutral descriptions
* Articulates **personal conclusions or lessons learned**
* Explicitly connects actions, choices, or experiences to **personal values or principles**

**2. Evaluation and conclusions (mandatory):**
The blogger does not just describe, but **analytically comments**:

* What genuinely worked or was liked
* What did not work or was disliked **and why**
* What deserves attention and why
* What experience or insight was gained

**3. Personal opinion vs. borrowed narratives (mandatory):**
The blogger clearly formulates **their own opinion**, not a retransmission of brand or external messaging.

Clear distinctions include:

* Instead of: “I was sent a pillow”
* The blogger says:

  * “I like that it gives me ___, because ___ is important to me.”
  * “This brand resonates with me because it shares my idea/value of ___.”
  * “I choose ___ because my principles are ___.”

**Key signals:**

* First-person language ("I choose", "it matters to me", "for me")
* Explicit value-based reasoning
* Consistent personal stance across frames or content pieces

If readable captions/on-screen text or clear speaking-to-camera cues are **absent**, **reduce Confidence**, even if the visual storytelling appears polished.

---

### 14. Enthusiasm & Positive Energy

Score = 100 if the blogger consistently radiates enthusiasm, optimism, and positive emotional energy, clearly visible in facial expressions, gestures, and readable on-screen text/captions.

The blogger:

Speaks with light liveliness and emotional accents

Smiles naturally, not forced or strained

Uses a warm, friendly tone — without sarcasm, fatigue, irritation, or bitterness

Shows energetic, engaging intonation; speech does not feel dragging or monotonous

Laughs easily or jokes naturally, when appropriate

Does not demonstrate constant complaining, whining, or negativity

Additional positive markers:

Talks about topics as if they genuinely interest them

Emphasizes positives, opportunities, and new ideas, rather than problems

Explicitly notes:

what has improved

what they like

what inspires them

Avoids toxic criticism, cynical framing, and persistent complaints

If enthusiasm is inferred only weakly from visuals or captions, reduce Confidence accordingly.
---

### 15. Charisma & Ability to Inspire

**Score = 100** if the blogger can emotionally engage and "infect" others with ideas, values, or passion.

The blogger:

* Consistently communicates core beliefs (health, beauty, self-care, quality of life)
* Explains why these beliefs matter personally
* Is not afraid to take a clear position and speak from first person

Delivery signals:

* Speaks with energy and emotional involvement
* Uses expressive facial expressions and intonation
* Shows genuine enjoyment of the content creation process
* Uses phrases like "This really works", "I want you to try this too"
* Avoids indifferent or checklist-style product descriptions

Additional strength signals:

* Uses rhythm, pauses, and structure in speech
* Varies content formats (stories, POV, backstage, emotional addresses)

* Explains **why** it is used (personal motivation)
* Describes **specific situations** in which the product is relevant
* Demonstrates the product in a **realistic, non-idealized way** (not overly polished or staged)

**Lifestyle integration**

* Shows that the integration is **not random**
* Demonstrates that the product **supports and fits their lifestyle**, habits, or routines
* Product appears naturally embedded into daily life shown in frames

**Concrete details & specificity**

* Mentions **specific, tangible effects or observations**:

  * e.g. “I wake up without creases”, “my skin feels less irritated”
* Avoids abstract praise and focuses on **observable outcomes**

**Contextual integration**

* Connects the integration to context or audience interaction:

  * “you often ask what I use”
  * “I was looking for something to fix morning creases”
* Avoids abrupt transitions like “Now advertising” unless the format explicitly requires it

**Authentic voice & tone**

* Uses **their own natural manner of speech** and personal tone
* Does not sound like reading a script or brand copy

**Credibility & restraint**

* Avoids exaggerated or absolute claims (“the best product in the world”)
* Focuses on **specific advantages**, not empty superlatives

**Real need → solution link**

* Describes a **real personal problem or need**:

  * acne, sensitive skin, frequent travel, lack of sleep, irritation, etc.
* Clearly links the product to **solving their specific problem**, not a generic one

**Trust-enhancing nuance**

* May mention a **small nuance, limitation, or wish**
* Light imperfection is treated as a **positive trust signal**

If readable captions/on-screen text are missing and speech cannot be reliably inferred from frames, **reduce Confidence accordingly**, even if the visual presentation appears premium.

### 8. Frequency of Advertising

* **100** — Advertising appears inside each post
* **0** — No advertising present across the analyzed content

---

### 9. Structured Thinking & Argumentation

**Score = 100** if the blogger demonstrates **clear, structured, and reasoned thinking**, going far beyond simple statements like “I like / I don’t like”.

The blogger **does NOT limit themselves to opinions**, but:

* Explains **why** they think so
* Provides **examples from practice**:

  * personal experience ("on myself", "in my routine")
  * experience with others (clients / followers, if visible via captions)
* Clearly links **cause and effect**:

  * “if you do X, Y usually happens”
* Sometimes **compares approaches**:

  * “this works like this, while that works differently, because…”

**Language & clarity requirements:**

* Speaks in **simple, clear sentences**, without unnecessary filler
* Explains complex terms **when they are used**
* Avoids excessive professional jargon not common outside expert sources
* Gives not only **“what to do”**, but also **“why it works”**

**Mandatory argument types to look for:**

1. **Arguments based on personal experience**

   * first‑person statements
   * visible routines or repeated personal usage

2. **Arguments based on observation and comparison**

   * before / after comparisons
   * comparison with alternatives or analogs
   * explanation of differences
   * explanation of why one option worked and others did not

3. **Logical and cause–effect arguments**

   * clear explanation of why a certain effect occurs
   * reasoning chains (X → Y → result)

4. **Arguments through concrete usage scenarios**

   * shows *how*, *when*, and *in which situations* something is used
   * usage tied to real-life context

**Strong scoring formats:**

* Before / after comparisons
* Comparison with analogs
* Explanation of distinctions
* Explanation of why this method worked and others failed

If readable captions/on‑screen text or clear speaking‑to‑camera cues are **absent**, significantly **reduce Confidence**, even if the visual style appears polished.

### 10. Knowledge Depth & Usefulness

**Score = 100** if the blogger demonstrates **high relevance, freshness, and rarity of transmitted knowledge**, even without formal expert credentials.

The assessment must be based on **how far the information is from mass awareness** and **at what stage of societal diffusion the knowledge currently is**.

Use the following **knowledge diffusion levels**:

1. **Scientific innovation** — information originates from narrow academic or scientific journals and research circles
2. **Narrow professional knowledge** — known to a small group of professionals, circulates in specialized or semi-academic publications
3. **Professional mainstream (priority level)** — accessible to a wide professional audience and starting to appear in high-quality press
4. **Advanced enthusiast knowledge (acceptable)** — known to deeply engaged enthusiasts and hobbyists, already present in popular media
5. **Mass / overused knowledge** — widely known, generic, repeated, and commonly encountered

**Primary target level:** **Level 3**
**Acceptable:** Level 4 (since most bloggers operate in this zone)
Levels **1–2** are strong positive signals but rare.
Level **5** should significantly lower the score.

**Key evaluation criteria:**

* Rarity of information relative to mass content
* Actuality and freshness (not outdated or recycled insights)
* Presence of non-obvious details, nuances, or trade-offs
* Evidence that the blogger understands *why* the concept works, not just *what* it is

**Strong signals include:**

* Explaining concepts before they become widely popular
* Translating professional knowledge into accessible explanations
* Highlighting limitations, conditions, or edge cases
* Connecting insights to real-world application shown in frames or captions

If there is **no readable caption/on-screen text** or clear evidence of knowledge transmission, **reduce Confidence accordingly**, even if the visual presentation appears premium.

---

### 11. Age Over 35

* **100** — provided video frames strongly indicates blogger is over 35
* **0** — provided video frames strongly indicates blogger is under 35

---

### 12. Intelligence

**Score = 100** if the blogger demonstrates high cognitive and communicative intelligence.

Evaluate across two dimensions:

**Speech & Thinking:**

* Clear and logical structure of speech
* Rich but precise vocabulary (without overload)
* Ability to explain complex ideas in simple terms
* Consistency and ability to justify positions
* Presence of irony or self-irony (optional but strong signal)

**Analytical Ability:**

* Quickly grasps the essence of topics
* Highlights the main points without getting lost in details
* Compares and generalizes
* Demonstrates critical thinking (does not accept everything at face value)

---

### 13. Personal Values & “Own Truth”

**Score = 100** if the blogger consistently demonstrates a **personal worldview, values, and principles**, going beyond simple documentation of events.

The blogger **does not merely show events** ("what I eat / do / visit"), but **actively interprets them**.

**1. Interpretation of events (mandatory):**

* Explains **why** they act or choose something in a particular way
* Expresses **personal likes and dislikes**, not neutral descriptions
* Articulates **personal conclusions or lessons learned**
* Explicitly connects actions, choices, or experiences to **personal values or principles**

**2. Evaluation and conclusions (mandatory):**
The blogger does not just describe, but **analytically comments**:

* What genuinely worked or was liked
* What did not work or was disliked **and why**
* What deserves attention and why
* What experience or insight was gained

**3. Personal opinion vs. borrowed narratives (mandatory):**
The blogger clearly formulates **their own opinion**, not a retransmission of brand or external messaging.

Clear distinctions include:

* Instead of: “I was sent a pillow”
* The blogger says:

  * “I like that it gives me ___, because ___ is important to me.”
  * “This brand resonates with me because it shares my idea/value of ___.”
  * “I choose ___ because my principles are ___.”

**Key signals:**

* First-person language ("I choose", "it matters to me", "for me")
* Explicit value-based reasoning
* Consistent personal stance across frames or content pieces

If readable captions/on-screen text or clear speaking-to-camera cues are **absent**, **reduce Confidence**, even if the visual storytelling appears polished.

---

### 14. Enthusiasm & Positive Energy

Score = 100 if the blogger consistently radiates enthusiasm, optimism, and positive emotional energy, clearly visible in facial expressions, gestures, and readable on-screen text/captions.

The blogger:

Speaks with light liveliness and emotional accents

Smiles naturally, not forced or strained

Uses a warm, friendly tone — without sarcasm, fatigue, irritation, or bitterness

Shows energetic, engaging intonation; speech does not feel dragging or monotonous

Laughs easily or jokes naturally, when appropriate

Does not demonstrate constant complaining, whining, or negativity

Talks about topics as if they genuinely interest them

Emphasizes positives, opportunities, and new ideas, rather than problems

Explicitly notes:

what has improved

what they like

what inspires them

If enthusiasm is inferred only weakly from visuals or captions, reduce Confidence accordingly.
---

### 15. Charisma & Ability to Inspire

The blogger:

* Consistently communicates core beliefs (health, beauty, self-care, quality of life)
* Explains why these beliefs matter personally
* Is not afraid to take a clear position and speak from first person

Delivery signals:

* Speaks with energy and emotional involvement

* Shows genuine enjoyment of the content creation process
* Uses phrases like "This really works", "I want you to try this too"
* Avoids indifferent or checklist-style product descriptions

Additional strength signals:

* Uses rhythm, pauses, and structure in speech
* Varies content formats (stories, POV, backstage, emotional addresses)
